- ğŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @criskgsdev / Cristian MÄƒndoiu 

Currently living in PiteÈ™ti, ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡´ 

I've started the journey of self-learning Frontend Development on 1st of May 2022 (my 28th birthday), having almost no background in this field, not a single line of Code written until then.

In this point I teach myself using multiple sources: books, websites  (The Odin Project / W3schools / MDN web books) and YouTube videos.

The main goal that I set is to be employed as a Frontend Dev. by the 1st of May 2022 or even earlier. ğŸ¦¸
