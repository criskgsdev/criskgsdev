- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @criskgsdev / <b>Cristian MÄƒndoiu</b>

Currently living in PiteÈ™ti, ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ 

I've started the journey of <b>self-learning</b> Frontend Development on 1st of May 2022 (my 28th birthday), having almost no background in this field, not a <b>single</b> line of code written till then.

In this point I teach myself using multiple sources: books, websites  (Free Code Camp, The Odin Project / W3schools / MDN web books) and YouTube videos.

The main goal that I set is to be employed as a Frontend Dev. by the 1st of May 2023 or even earlier. 

I know that is a long, twisted road ahead but I'm going to make it, just watch me. ðŸ¦¸
