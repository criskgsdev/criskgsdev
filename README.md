- 👋 Hello, I’m @criskgsdev / Cristian Măndoiu 

Currently living in Pitești, 🇷🇴 

I've started the journey of self-learning Frontend Development on 1st of May 2022 (my 28th birthday), having almost no background in this field, not a single line of Code written until then.

In this point I teach myself using multiple sources: books, websites  (The Odin Project / W3schools / MDN web books) and YouTube videos.

The main goal that I set is to be employed as a Frontend Dev. by the 1st of May 2023 or even earlier. 

I know that is a long, twisted road ahead but I'm going to make it, just watch me. 🦸
